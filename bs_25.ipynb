    "#### 1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "**Ans:** both square brackets and parentheses can be used to enclose a list comprehension, but they have different meanings and produce different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a list comprehension is enclosed in square brackets, it creates a new list object that contains the results of the comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "When a list comprehension is enclosed in parentheses, it creates a new generator object that generates the results of the comprehension on the fly as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between using square brackets and parentheses to enclose a list comprehension is that square brackets create a new list object, while parentheses create a new generator object. Depending on the use case, one or the other may be more appropriate. If you need to access the results of the comprehension multiple times or modify them in place, a list comprehension may be more appropriate. If you only need to iterate over the results once or want to conserve memory, a generator expression enclosed in parentheses may be more appropriate."

    "#### 2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "**Ans:** Generators and iterators are related concepts in Python, as generators are a type of iterator. Both generators and iterators are used to iterate over a sequence of values, but they differ in how they generate those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which consists of the __iter__() and __next__() methods. The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next value in the sequence or raises the StopIteration exception when there are no more values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators, on the other hand, are a type of iterator that are defined using a function that contains the yield keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the values generated by the function. Each time the yield keyword is encountered in the function, the current value is returned to the caller and the state of the function is saved. The next time the generator is iterated, the function resumes execution from where it left off and generates the next value."

    "**Ans:** The yield statement is used in Python to create a generator function that generates a sequence of values on the fly. It allows a function to return a value and then continue from where it left off when called again, instead of starting over from the beginning like a regular function.\n",

    "#### 5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The main differences between map calls and list comprehensiosn are:\n",
    "1. List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map.\n",
    "2. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example, to print all odd numbers in range of 50, we can write `[n for n in range(50) if n%2 != 0]`. There is no alternate for it in map\n",
    "3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as final output.but map only returns a map object. it needs to be explicitly coverted to desired datatype.\n",
    "4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express\n",
    "5. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function on a set of values."
