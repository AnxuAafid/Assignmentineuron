    "TensorFlow is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy, but it does share some similarities and can be used alongside NumPy. Here are the main differences between TensorFlow and NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computation Paradigm: NumPy is primarily focused on array-based operations and provides a powerful and efficient multi-dimensional array object. It is commonly used for numerical computations and scientific computing. TensorFlow, on the other hand, is a library for building and training deep neural networks. It is designed to handle complex computational graphs and supports automatic differentiation for gradient-based optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Symbolic Computation: TensorFlow introduces the concept of symbolic computation, where computations are defined as a computational graph with operations and tensors. These graphs can be compiled and optimized before execution, allowing for efficient execution on different devices and distributed systems. NumPy, on the other hand, performs immediate computation using arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Automatic Differentiation: TensorFlow provides automatic differentiation, which enables efficient computation of gradients for training deep neural networks. This is essential for tasks such as backpropagation. NumPy does not have built-in support for automatic differentiation, although external libraries like Autograd can be used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. GPU Acceleration: TensorFlow provides seamless integration with GPUs for accelerating computations. It includes GPU support out of the box, allowing for significant speedups in deep learning tasks. While NumPy can utilize GPUs through external libraries like CuPy, it does not have native GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ecosystem and Community: TensorFlow has a large and active community, making it popular for deep learning research and development. It offers a wide range of pre-built models, tools, and resources for various machine learning tasks. NumPy, on the other hand, is widely used in scientific computing and has a mature ecosystem with extensive libraries and tools for numerical computations.\n"
