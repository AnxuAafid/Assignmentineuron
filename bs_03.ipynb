    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",

    "**Ans:** The code in a function runs when the function is called, not when it is specified.\n",
    "When you define a function in Python, you are essentially creating a block of code that can be executed later by calling the function. The code inside the function definition is not executed until the function is actually called in your program.\n",

This return value can then be used by the calling code for further processing. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression."
